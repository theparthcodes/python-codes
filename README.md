All my Python beginner projects using loops, logic, and practice ðŸš€

# This is my first small project on github which is "MULTIPLICATION_TABLE_GENERATOR"

- It first takes input from the user in the form of an integer.
- After that it forward takes place as the command provided in the code and generates the table of any number the user wants.

# CONCEPTS USED :
- Python `for` loop
- `input()` and `int()` functions
